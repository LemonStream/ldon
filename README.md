Mira. Not intended for wild use, not guaranteed to work. Weak groups with bad automation will still die. Doesn't handle failure states.
/lua run ldon in everfrost. Have your group together and running their automation. Automation must kill once they get agro. This will move to points and get agro.
Need to edit the init.lua to add your drivers class and pull ability. 
recordlocs.lua included. This tool creates the loc file data for the points.
No hard mode.
No hunter (yet, too weak)
